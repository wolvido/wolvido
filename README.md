## Hi there, I'm Winzyl Olvido

### 🌟 Software Developer | React & React Native | .NET
- I’ve been into computers and software since I was a kid, but I only began coding seriously with C# and .NET in recent years. Over the past year, I’ve been working professionally with .NET on the backend and React / React Native on the frontend.
- I use AI not to write my code, but to output huge lines of code as fast as I can think them, so i don't waste time typing them myself.
- I’m a big believer in keeping things simple. Simple readable componetized code is usually better than clever code, and in my experience it holds up much better as projects grow and change.
- Aside from technical skills, I strongly believe communication matters a lot. I prefer working in agile teams, getting feedback early, and iterating often, and I try to be someone that’s easy to approach and straightforward to collaborate with.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- Languages & Frameworks: React, React Native, .NET Core, Entity Framework Core.

### 🚧 Current Endeavors: 
**Check out what im currently building**
- Developing a React Native foundation kit from the ground up, built for real-world, production-ready apps. Every decision—from architecture to folder structure is aimed at making code scalable, maintainable, and easy for teams to extend.
- [**FruitFund Tracker**](https://github.com/wolvido/FruitFund-Tracker): What started as a small group of women, including my mother, where each member contributed a fixed monthly amount. At the end of the year, the pooled money was used to bulk buy 12 kinds of fruits for each member to celebrate the Filipino New Year tradition of having 12 fruits.
