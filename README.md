## Hi there, I'm Winzyl Olvido

### 🌟 Aspiring Full-Stack Developer | .NET Focus | Angular Learner
I've been enmaored with computers and softwares ever since I was a child.  
I started my serious coding journey learning C# and .NET.  
In my opinion a mature statically typed language such as C# is and a structured framework such as .NET is much better when maintaining software, especially in the long term.  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- Languages & Frameworks: .NET Core, Entity Framework Core, JQuery, xUnit Testing.  
- Tools: Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Git, Github.

### 🌱 What I'm Currently Learning:
- Deep diving into Angular for frontend development.  
- Exploring best practices in .NET development.
